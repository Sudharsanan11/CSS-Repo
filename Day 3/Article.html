                         Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in the Bihar team. Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior <span>Bihar Ranji Team</span> within one year.</p>

In the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar U-19 cricket team made it to the finals, where Dhoni's 84 helped Bihar post a total of 357.
                             Nevertheless, Bihar's efforts were thwarted by <span>Punjab's</span> 839 with Dhoni's future teammate <span>Yuvraj Singh</span> making 358.
